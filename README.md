# Lunch Money Entry

## Setup

```
npm run dev
```

This also generates the ports' type definitions. If you see an error about missing type declarations for Elm, run this.

## Build

```
npm run build:android
```

For Fairphone, it is enough to target aarch64 instead of all plattforms. The build script only builds for that plattform.
